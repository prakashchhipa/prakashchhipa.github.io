Prakash brings over 13 years of machine learning R&D experience spanning computer vision, self-supervised learning, foundation models, multimodality, and generative AI. From training large-scale models to leading teams and translating ideas into publications, patents, and products—he bridges scientific depth with real-world impact.

He is a researcher and applied scientist, currently a WASP Fellow and ELLIS Member, holding a PhD in Machine Learning from Luleå University of Technology, Sweden (2025). His research advances robust, domain-aware self-supervised learning—starting from modeling fundamental yet natural phenomena of scene distortion caused by camera perspective, leading to improved robustness in real-world tasks such as object detection, crowd analytics, and person re-identification; extending to reinforcement learning–driven adversarial attacks, and adapting self-supervised methods across domains—from industrial mines to medical imaging. He has published in ICLR, ECCV, ACCV, WACV, and served as reviewer, invited talk speaker, and visiting researcher at UCF, received multiple grants and fellowships, and collaborated with leading researchers worldwide. He is currently working on multimodal foundation models, aiming to make them more robust, adaptable, and practically useful for real-world applications.

Before academia, he spent a decade in industrial R&D. At Samsung R&D (2012–2018), he built large-scale vision systems and ad-recommendation models, leading to 11 international patents (5 granted) cited by major tech companies. Later at Arkray R&D (2018–2020), he led the ML team developing AI-driven diagnostics (Aution Eye AI 4510), merging healthcare and machine learning innovation.

Open for Research Scientist roles and discussions. Please check his updated CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pzAf7G9xs9IzwEk3AyRk8VnPJsVlNH6V/view?usp=sharing).
