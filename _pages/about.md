Currently, Prakash Chandra Chhipa is a Computer Vision Researcher, Ph.D. Candidate at Machine Learning Group at Luleå University of Technology, Sweden, advised by [Prof. Marcus Liwicki](https://www.ltu.se/en/staff/m/marcus-liwicki). Earlier, he proudly contributed to industrial R&D for 8+ years in machine learning and computer vision with multiple MNCs. He has a long-term track record in identifying challenges -> growing research ideas -> building prototypes -> inventing intellectual properties -> developing commercialized products.

Prakash's research interest is representation learning in computer vision. His emphasis on doctoral research is two-fold. First, working self-supervised representation learning methods for their efficient adaptations on different visual domains such as medical imaging, remote sensing, RGBD images, and others where visual concepts predominantly differ from natural scenes and human supervision is limited. Second, he is working on understanding the effect of distribution shifts on representation learning due to natural and synthetic causes in the real world and attempting to make representation learning robust by mitigating it.
