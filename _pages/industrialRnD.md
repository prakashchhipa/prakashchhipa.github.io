## Why It Matters

These experiences form the foundation of my research-driven entrepreneurial vision:
- **From prototypes to products**: I’ve led transitions from POCs to fully deployed AI systems navigating through the academic research.
- **End-to-end lifecycle**: From data engineering and model training to development on cloud deployment finsihing it with IP generation.
- **Multi-stakeholder collaboration**: Worked with academia, industrial R&D, product managers, designers, and end-users.

Today, I’m building on these foundations to develop **robust AI systems** with real-world utility, scaling research into commercially viable impact.
