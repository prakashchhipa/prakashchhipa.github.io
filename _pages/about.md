Prakash recieved PhD in Computer Vision in April 2025 from Luleå tekniska universitet, Sweden,  focusing on making self-supervised representation learning robust, domain-aware, and ready for the real world. From distorted camera views to unseen adversarial threats, his research aimed to make self-supervised AI more resilient, adaptable, and aware of the domains it serves—from hospitals to mines. He authored and co-authored dozens of works—within and beyond his thesis—with many publications in top-tier venues including ECCV, ICLR, ACCV, WACV, and more. During this journey, he served as a reviewer, delivered invited talks across three continents, and held a visiting researcher position. He also supervised four master’s theses, participated in prestigious summer schools, received multiple grants and fellowships, and was featured on credible platforms—all while collaborating with inspiring researchers across the globe.

Before academia, Prakash spent over a decade in industrial R&D, building AI systems from concept to real-world deployment. At Samsung R&D (2012–2018), he worked across roles—from individual contributor to senior staff—on projects like large-scale content recognition for Samsung TVs (ACR systems in the US, EU, and Korea), contextual ad recommendations using reinforcement learning, and video/music analysis pipelines. He contributed five invention disclosures and 11 international patent applications, including many granted patents with multimillion-dollar valuation.

At Arkray R&D (2018–2020), he built and led the AI team, significantly contributing in delivering products like AI-based urinalysis systems (launched in 2019) exploring blood glucose estimation models, and RNA-based early cancer detection tools. He bridged clinical needs and machine learning innovation—contributing to multiple patent filings and pushing AI into real-world healthcare diagnostics.

This spectrum of experience—from training large-scale models to leading teams, from prototypes to patents—enables him to drive high-impact AI research and build tangible, scalable products. His combined industry and academic journey makes him uniquely positioned to lead innovation where scientific depth meets product relevance.
