Currently, Prakash Chandra Chhipa is a dedicated Computer Vision Researcher and Ph.D. Candidate at the Machine Learning Group at Luleå University of Technology, Sweden, advised by [Prof. Marcus Liwicki](https://www.ltu.se/en/staff/m/marcus-liwicki). 

Before embarking on his academic journey, Prakash contributed significantly to industrial R&D for over eight years, specializing in machine learning and computer vision with several multinational companies. His experience spans identifying challenges, cultivating research ideas, developing prototypes, inventing intellectual properties, and transforming them into commercialized products.

Prakash's research is deeply rooted in computer vision and representation learning, with a particular focus on self-supervised learning (SSL). His doctoral work is two-fold: first, he focuses on robustness in self-supervised representation learning to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) performance, focusing on mitigating the impact of natural and synthetic distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. Second, he aims to develop domain-aware SSL methods tailored to diverse visual domains, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and RGB-D images, where visual concepts significantly deviate from natural scenes. Prakash's journey is driven by a genuine desire to bridge the gap between innovative research and impactful real-world solutions.
